# Formal abstracts

This repository is part of the *Formal abstracts* projects initiated by [Thomas Hales](https://sites.google.com/site/thalespitt/).

A **formal abstract**, or **fabstract** for short, is a formalization of the main results
(constructions, definitions, proofs, conjectures) of a piece of informal mathematics, such
as a research paper. There is no requirement that the entire text be formalized, and you
may leave any piece of it unformalized. Commonly, proofs of statements are omitted.

A formal abstract is *not* the formalization of the abstract itself.

If you are interested in the project, and especially if you plan to contribute, we kindly
invite you to join the [Formal abstracts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/formalabstracts).

### Contributing

Formal abstracts is a collaborative effort. Contributing even a single fabstract, or an
improvement of an existing one, is highly appreciated. Do not worry if you do not get it
quite right, the curators will help fix it.

You may add your own fabstracts, improve existing ones, and work on the folklore. You may
also contribute other people's fabstracts, but please be extra careful to get them right.

Please consult the [instructions](./instructions.markdown) on how to contribute.
