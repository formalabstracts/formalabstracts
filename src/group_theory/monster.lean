There's a 12-generator 80-relator presentation for the Monster group. Specifically, we have 78 relators for the Coxeter group Y443:12 relators of the form x^2=1
, one for each node in the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram;
11 relators of the form (xy)3=1, one for each pair of adjacent nodes; 55 relators of the form (xy)2=1 (commutators), one for each pair of non-adjacent nodes; together with a single 'spider' relator, (ab₁c₁ab₂c₂ab₃c₃)^10=1 , which results in the group M×C2. We can get rid of the C2 by quotienting out by an eightieth relation, x=1, where x is the unique non-identity element in the centre of the group. -/

/- coxeter_vertices [p,q,r] consists of a left arm of length p+1, a right arm of length q+1, and
a bottom arm of length r+1, with one node in the center connecting them.

arm i j gets the jth element of the ith arm, where both i and j start indexing from 0.
